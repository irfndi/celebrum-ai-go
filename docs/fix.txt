In docker-compose.ci.yml around lines 9 to 12, the compose file mixes enforced
POSTGRES_PASSWORD with TRUST authentication which bypasses password checks;
remove the TRUST-related settings to enforce password auth: delete the
POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS and POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD entries (keep
POSTGRES_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_DB) so CI uses password-based authentication, or
if you truly want TRUST instead, remove the POSTGRES_PASSWORD requirement —
prefer the first option and delete the two TRUST lines.

In docker-compose.ci.yml around lines 58–62 the healthcheck `test` sequence has
a trailing comma that breaks YAML parsing and the command assumes Bun exists in
the ccxt-service image; remove the trailing comma so the sequence is valid, and
either ensure the ccxt-service Dockerfile installs Bun (add installation steps)
or replace the healthcheck with a portable command that uses an available tool
(e.g., curl or wget) or a POSIX shell check (sh -c '...') so the healthcheck
will succeed if Bun is not present.

In docker-compose.ci.yml around lines 101 to 110, remove the trailing comma
after the last array entry in the test command to fix the YAML parse error, and
make the healthcheck robust by either ensuring the app image installs a small
HTTP client (add wget or curl to the Dockerfile) or switch the healthcheck to
use a client already present (for example replace wget with curl) or use
CMD-SHELL to run a simple shell check (e.g. a curl -f/http check) so the
healthcheck doesn't assume wget exists.
