# Cache Analysis and Context Cancellation Explanation

## Symbol Cache Implementation

### Cache Type: In-Memory (Not Redis)
The symbol cache in this application uses **in-memory storage**, not Redis. Here's how it works:

- **Location**: `internal/services/collector.go` - `SymbolCache` struct
- **Storage**: Go map with TTL (Time To Live) mechanism
- **Purpose**: Caches exchange symbols to reduce API calls to CCXT service
- **TTL**: Configurable expiration time for cached data

### Cache Statistics Added
The cache now includes comprehensive monitoring:

```go
type SymbolCacheStats struct {
    Hits   int64 // Cache hits
    Misses int64 // Cache misses  
    Sets   int64 // Cache sets
}
```

### Logging Features
- **Hit/Miss Logging**: Every cache access is logged
- **Periodic Statistics**: Cache stats logged every 10 minutes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track cache effectiveness

### Redis Usage in Application
While Redis is initialized and available, it's only used by:
- API routes (via `api.SetupRoutes`)
- Not used by the CollectorService symbol cache

## Context Cancellation Errors - Normal Behavior

### What Are These Errors?
The "context canceled" errors you see are **normal shutdown behavior**:

```
Failed to collect ticker data for binance:CRV/USDT:USDT: failed to fetch ticker data: failed to fetch ticker for binance:CRV/USDT:USDT: failed to make request: Get "http://ccxt-service:3000/api/ticker/binance/CRVUSDT:USDT": context canceled
```

### Why This Happens
1. **Graceful Shutdown**: When the application receives a shutdown signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
2. **Context Cancellation**: All ongoing HTTP requests are cancelled
3. **Worker Cleanup**: Each exchange worker stops cleanly
4. **Expected Behavior**: This prevents hanging requests during shutdown

### Normal Shutdown Sequence
1. "Shutting down server..."
2. "Stopping cleanup service"
3. "Stopping market data collector service..."
4. Context cancellation errors for in-flight requests
5. "Worker for exchange X stopping due to context cancellation"

## Cache Performance Monitoring

### How to Monitor
1. **Real-time Logs**: Watch for cache hit/miss messages
2. **Periodic Stats**: Every 10 minutes, cache statistics are logged
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track hit ratio to optimize cache TTL

### Expected Cache Behavior
- **First Request**: Cache miss, fetches from CCXT service
- **Subsequent Requests**: Cache hit (within TTL period)
- **After TTL Expiry**: Cache miss, refreshes data

## Conclusion

✅ **Cache is Working**: In-memory symbol cache with TTL is functioning correctly
✅ **Redis Available**: Redis is initialized but used for API routes, not symbol caching
✅ **Context Cancellation Normal**: Shutdown errors are expected graceful shutdown behavior
✅ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Added comprehensive cache statistics and logging

The application is working as designed. The cache reduces API calls effectively, and the context cancellation errors during shutdown are normal and expected behavior.
