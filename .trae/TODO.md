## âœ… **COMPLETED - Rate Limit Optimization**
- [x] **Increased Nginx Rate Limits**: API endpoints from 10 to 100 req/sec
- [x] **Optimized Burst Capacity**: From 20 to 100 concurrent requests
- [x] **Exchange-Specific Limits**: Configured optimal rate limits per exchange
- [x] **Collection Intervals**: Reduced from 5 minutes to 10-60 seconds

- [x] **Market Data**: Extended to 7 days retention for trend analysis
- [x] **Funding Rates**: Extended to 7 days retention for funding rate analysis
- [x] **Cleanup Frequency**: Reduced from hourly to every 6 hours
- [x] **Configuration Scripts**: Created enable/disable analytics persistence
- [x] **Documentation**: Added comprehensive setup and rollback guides

## ðŸ“‹ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS - Arbitrage System**
- [ ] Add deduplication logic with unique constraints
- [ ] Add opportunity expiration and invalidation mechanisms
- [ ] Implement analytics dashboard for historical opportunities
- [ ] Add data export functionality for analytics

## ðŸš€ **CI/CD IMPROVEMENT ANSWER**
**Current rsync command you mentioned:**
```bash
rsync -avz --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' /Users/irfandi/Coding/2025/celebrum-ai-go/ root@143.198.219.213:/root/celebrum-ai-go/
```

**Solution to eliminate manual rsync after every push:**
The enhanced deployment system now provides:

1. **GitHub Actions Integration** - Automatic deployment on push to main branch
2. **Zero-downtime deployment** - No manual rsync needed
3. **Manual fallback option** - Still supports rsync when needed

**Usage:**
- `make deploy` - Automated zero-downtime deployment
- `make deploy-manual` - Traditional rsync (when you need it)
- GitHub Actions will handle automatic deployment on push
