# SigNoz Observability Implementation Architecture

## 1. Product Overview

Comprehensive observability implementation using SigNoz with OpenTelemetry across our multi-language arbitrage trading application stack. This solution provides distributed tracing, error tracking, and performance monitoring for Go 1.25 server, Node.js CCXT service, Redis, and PostgreSQL components.

The implementation enables end-to-end visibility across all services, real-time error root cause analysis, and performance optimization insights for the cryptocurrency arbitrage detection system.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

| Role | Access Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| DevOps Engineer | SigNoz Dashboard Admin | Full access to all traces, metrics, logs, and system configuration |
| Developer | SigNoz Dashboard User | View traces, errors, and performance metrics for debugging |
| System Administrator | SigNoz Dashboard Viewer | Monitor system health, alerts, and service status |

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our SigNoz observability implementation consists of the following main components:

1. **SigNoz Dashboard**: Central monitoring interface, distributed tracing visualization, error tracking, performance metrics
2. **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Data aggregation hub, trace processing, metrics collection, log forwarding
3. **Service Instrumentation**: Go 1.25 server tracing, Node.js CCXT service monitoring, database query tracking
4. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Redis performance tracking, PostgreSQL query analysis, system resource monitoring
5. **Alert Management**: Error threshold alerts, performance degradation notifications, service health monitoring

### 2.3 Page Details

| Component | Module | Feature Description |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| SigNoz Dashboard | Traces View | Visualize distributed traces across all services, analyze request flows, identify bottlenecks |
| SigNoz Dashboard | Metrics View | Monitor service performance, track custom business metrics, view system resource usage |
| SigNoz Dashboard | Logs View | Centralized log aggregation, structured log search, correlation with traces |
| SigNoz Dashboard | Alerts Management | Configure alert rules, manage notification channels, track alert history |
| OpenTelemetry Collector | Data Processing | Receive telemetry data, process and enrich traces, forward to SigNoz backend |
| Go Server | Instrumentation | HTTP request tracing, database query spans, custom business logic tracking |
| Node.js CCXT | Instrumentation | Exchange API call tracing, market data processing spans, error tracking |
| Redis | Monitoring | Command execution tracking, connection pool monitoring, performance metrics |
| PostgreSQL | Monitoring | Query execution tracing, connection monitoring, slow query detection |

## 3. Core Process

### Main Observability Flow

1. **Service Initialization**: Each service (Go server, Node.js CCXT, Redis, PostgreSQL) initializes OpenTelemetry SDK with proper configuration
2. **Trace Generation**: Services automatically generate spans for HTTP requests, database queries, external API calls, and custom business operations
3. **Data Collection**: OpenTelemetry Collector receives telemetry data from all services via OTLP protocol
4. **Data Processing**: Collector processes, enriches, and forwards trace data to SigNoz backend for storage and analysis
5. **Visualization**: SigNoz dashboard provides real-time visualization of traces, metrics, and logs for monitoring and debugging
6. **Alert Processing**: Alert rules evaluate incoming data and trigger notifications when thresholds are exceeded

### Error Tracking Flow

1. **Error Detection**: Services capture exceptions and errors automatically through OpenTelemetry instrumentation
2. **Context Enrichment**: Error spans include relevant context like user ID, request parameters, and system state
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: SigNoz correlates errors with distributed traces to identify the root cause across services
4. **Alert Generation**: Critical errors trigger immediate alerts to development and operations teams
