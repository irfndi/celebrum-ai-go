-- Minimal init script - migrations will handle schema creation
-- This file ensures the database is initialized but doesn't create tables
-- Tables will be created by the migration system

-- Ensure database exists (PostgreSQL will create it automatically)
-- This file just needs to exist for the volume mount to work
