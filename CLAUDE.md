## Architecture Overview

This is a **monorepo** with all services organized under the `services/` directory.

### Core Components

1. **Backend API Service** (`services/backend-api/`)
   - Go backend service with Gin web framework
   - `cmd/server/main.go`: Entry point for the Go application
   - `internal/api/`: HTTP handlers for REST API endpoints
   - `internal/services/`: Business logic (arbitrage, analysis, signals)
   - `internal/models/`: Database entities and data structures
   - `internal/database/`: PostgreSQL and Redis integration

2. **CCXT Service** (`services/ccxt-service/`)
   - Bun/TypeScript service for exchange integration
   - Real-time market data collection via CCXT library
   - Supports 100+ cryptocurrency exchanges

3. **Telegram Service** (`services/telegram-service/`)
   - Bun/TypeScript bot service using grammY
   - Real-time alerts for arbitrage opportunities
   - Supports polling and webhook modes

4. **Shared Components**
   - `protos/`: Protocol Buffer definitions for gRPC communication
   - `docs/`: Project documentation

### Key Design Patterns

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear layers
- **Microservices**: Go backend + TypeScript CCXT service
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for external services
- **Background Processing**: Workers for data collection and analysis

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.25+ with Gin web framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Redis 7+ for caching
- **Market Data**: CCXT via Bun service for exchange integration
- **Testing**: testify, pgxmock, miniredis
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on Coolify
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated deployment via Coolify

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+
- Bun 1.0+ (for CCXT service)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/irfndi/celebrum-ai-go.git
cd celebrum-ai-go
cp .env.example .env

# Start development environment (PostgreSQL, Redis)
make dev-setup

# Install Go dependencies
cd services/backend-api && go mod download && cd ../..

# Install TypeScript dependencies (if using bun)
cd services/ccxt-service && bun install && cd ../..
cd services/telegram-service && bun install && cd ../..

# Build and run the application
make build
make run

# Or run with Docker Compose (recommended)
make docker-run
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure
- Unit tests: Individual component testing
- Integration tests: Database and external service testing
- E2E tests: Full workflow testing
- Performance tests: Load and stress testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (Go + TypeScript)
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific Go package
cd services/backend-api && go test -v ./internal/services/...

# Run with race detection
cd services/backend-api && go test -race ./...

# Run TypeScript tests
cd services/ccxt-service && bun test
cd services/telegram-service && bun test
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Database connections (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- API keys and exchange credentials
- JWT secrets and authentication
- External service configurations

### Configuration Files
- `config.yml`: Default configuration
- `.env`: Environment-specific overrides
- `docker-compose.yml`: Single Docker configuration

## Deployment Architecture

### Coolify + Docker

The project uses Coolify for deployment management:

1. **Automated Deployment**: Pushing to the repository triggers deployment via Coolify webhooks.
2. **Unified Dockerfile**: The root `Dockerfile` builds all services (Backend API, CCXT, Telegram).
3. **Split Deployment**: Each service also has its own `Dockerfile` in `services/<service>/Dockerfile`.
4. **Environment Management**: Managed through Coolify's UI or `.env` file.
5. **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose.yaml` orchestrates all services for local development.


## Observability and Monitoring

### Health Checks
- `/health` endpoint for service monitoring
- Individual service health monitoring
- Database connectivity checks
- External service availability

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication with middleware
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Environment variable management for secrets
- SSL/TLS encryption for production
- Input validation and sanitization
- Database connection pooling and security

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for frequently accessed data
- Symbol cache for exchange information
- Blacklist cache for filtering
- Cache warming for critical data

### Database Optimization
- Connection pooling with pgx
- Query optimization and indexing
- Read/write splitting for scaling
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Resource Management
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Timeout management for API calls
- Resource pooling and reuse
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Common Development Patterns

### Error Handling
- Custom error types with context
- Structured error responses
- Graceful degradation
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log levels and filtering
- Centralized log aggregation

### Testing Patterns
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Integration tests with real databases
- Benchmark tests for performance critical paths

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Database connection issues: Check PostgreSQL and Redis status
- CCXT service problems: Verify Bun installation and dependencies
- Performance issues: Monitor resource usage and query performance
- Deployment failures: Check Coolify logs and server configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check logs
make logs

# Database operations
make migrate-status
make migrate
