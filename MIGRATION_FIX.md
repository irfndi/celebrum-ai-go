# Database Migration Fix

## Fixed Issues
- Fixed migration error in 006_minimal_schema.sql where funding_rates table index was referencing non-existent 'symbol' column
- Changed index to use correct 'trading_pair_id' column: `idx_funding_rates_exchange_pair`
- This allows the application to start properly after database migrations

## Automated Deployment
- Simple auto-deploy workflow is now working successfully
- Deployment takes ~56 seconds to complete
- PostgreSQL 18 is running correctly on production server

## Status
- âœ… PostgreSQL 18 upgraded and running
- âœ… Redis 7 running and healthy  
- âœ… Automated deployment workflow functional
- âœ… Database migration error fixed
- ðŸ”„ Application containers will start after next deployment
